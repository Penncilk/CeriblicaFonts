# CeriblicaFonts
The fonts I use in my games


Notes from the Cello Font Team:
The Cello Font is focused on consistancy, as such, a lot of changes were made to the symbols to make them thinner, to replicate the majority of the symbols, 

an example of this would be the numbers, they are all the same thickness now.

Some JP symbols were also changed to be more readable.
